# CEG4912_Solar_Pannel_Assessment_Tool
This is the capstone project for CEG4912

The purpose of this project is to gather light intensity data in order to determine the pest position for a potential solar panel. This is done by determining the angle where the sun shines the brightest at any point during the day.
